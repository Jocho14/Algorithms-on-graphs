# Algorithms-on-graphs
A test of the efficiency of graph algorithms depending on the size of the instance and the way of representation of graphs in computer memory.
The project includes algorithms such as Prim and Kruskal algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree and finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
